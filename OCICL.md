OCICL is a complete secure alternative to a QuickLisp CLOG install

Note: New project temlates contain setup-ocicl and run-ocicl for builder
      so only need to install OCICL.

OCICL loads dependencies with your project. Once setup the command line
tool ocicl is used to prepare a directory for a new project or to convert
and existing project to an ocicl based one. To add dependecies you just
add them to your asd file and will be downloaded as needed. A simple
run of "ocicl latest" updates your project dependecies.

Once installed either in an empty new project dir or existing project do:
(Do not call your project clog, that creates an asdf circular dependecy.)

```
ocicl setup > init
ocicl install clog
```
Note for Windows: unzip https://rabbibotton.github.io/clog/clogframe.zip for
                  needed dlls in directory

Then compile the CLOG Builder:

```
sbcl --userinit init --eval "(asdf:load-system :clog/tools)" --quit
```

Run "bash edit-ocicl" (or chmod 775 edit-oicl to make the batch file executable)

(or replace ecl for sbcl)

On Windows:

```
sbcl --userinit init --eval "(setf asdf:*compile-file-failure-behaviour* :warn)" --eval "(asdf:load-system :clog/tools)" --quit"
```

Run "edit-ocicl.bat"


Update ocicl libraries like CLOG with:

```
./update-ocicl
```

Only check the systems.cvs file in, on the systems directory. A new check out
can run the setup-ocicl script to load the libraries again.

The script run-ocicl or run-ocicl.bat can be used to directly start you application with out the builder.

=============

These are directions for getting started from scratch:

* Step 1 - Install SBCL *

Linux:

Use OS package manager like for example

```
sudo apt-get install sbcl
```

Mac:

On Mac install homebrew from https://brew.sh/

```
brew install sbcl
brew install ocicl
```

For Mac - skip step 2 - you are ready to go!

Windows:

On Windows install Windows AMD 64 from here -
  https://www.sbcl.org/platform-table.html
For example:
   http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/sbcl/sbcl-2.4.6-x86-64-windows-binary.msi


* Step 2 - Install OCICL *

Create a dir for example projects and cd to it then do:

```
git clone https://github.com/ocicl/ocicl.git
```

the cd in to ocicl and run to create ocicl in ~/.local/bin:

```
sbcl --load setup.lisp
```

Make sure the created ocicl is on your PATH

On Linux:

Close your terminal and reopen and in most distros is, as .local/bin is usually
added if exists.

On Windows:

Permanently make available, by using:

search then type env -> then pick Edit the system environment variables
click the button environment variables -> select Path under User variables
click Edit... -> New and type "%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\ocicl\bin\"
"Close the terminal and open a new one


* Step 3 - Create your project directory

Note: ~/common-lisp is always searched so make sure no conflicts in most cases
      you do not want that directory to exist

(If converting a clog project just do in the directory with your .asd file)

For this example using projects/ctest

cd to projects/ctest

```
ocicl setup > init
ocicl install clog
```
Note: run frequenlty oclicl latest to get the latest version of clog

Note for Windows: unzip https://rabbibotton.github.io/clog/clogframe.zip for
                  needed dlls in directory. You will also need to add to sbcl
                  --eval "(setf asdf:*compile-file-failure-behaviour* :warn)"

To use sbcl any time in your own ocicl world use:
```
sbcl --userinit init
```

and to start the builder in sbcl:

```
(asdf:load-system :clog/tools)
(clog-tools:clog-builder)
```

If this is the new project an .asd file, first .lisp file and www directory
will be created as well. Batch files that will use your asd files to load
plugins are also configured run-ocicl.bat / run-ocicl and run-ql.bat / run-ql
are also created.

Update ocicl frequenlty with:

```
ocicl latest
```
